# Simgrid XML Platform Description File Visualizer

## Usage

To run:
```
cd my-cytoreact-app 
npm start
```

### Known Bugs and Limitations

  - CytoScape force-directed layout does not work

  - When uploading a file after a file was previously uploaded may cause a crash

  - The export functionality does not export routes correctly. This is due to object ids not being mapped back to original object ids in the imported XML file.
